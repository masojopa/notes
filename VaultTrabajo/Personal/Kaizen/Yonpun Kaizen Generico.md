** *"Yonpun Kaizen" translates to "four-step Kaizen" in Japanese. It refers to a specific, structured approach to continuous improvement.* **

### **Plan**
- This involves identifying a problem or area for improvement and developing a plan to address it. This includes setting goals, gathering data, and creating a strategy.
    
### **Do**
- The plan is put into action. This phase involves implementing the changes outlined in the plan

### **Check**
- After implementing the changes, the results are evaluated to see if they have had the desired effect. This involves analyzing data and comparing it to the planned goals.

### **Act**
- Based on the results of the check phase, adjustments are made to the plan or the implementation process. If the changes were successful, they may be standardized and incorporated into the regular process. If not, further adjustments are made, and the cycle begins again.


This continuous cycle of planning, doing, checking, and acting is at the heart of the Kaizen philosophy, which emphasizes incremental, ongoing improvements to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
