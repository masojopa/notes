On the flip side of the canvas, we find Key Activities.

These are the critical tasks that keep your restaurant operational. It encompasses food prep, stock management, marketing, and upkeep of your establishment.

Pinpoint the activities vital to delivering your value proposition and strategize on how to perform them effectively.

Key activities are the most important actions your company must perform to make its business model work effectively. They represent the critical tasks required to create and deliver your value proposition, reach markets, maintain customer relationships, and generate revenue.Categories of Key ActivitiesProduction activities involve creating and manufacturing your core offering. For manufacturing companies, this includes sourcing materials, assembly, quality control, and inventory management. For software companies, it encompasses development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Service businesses focus on service delivery, process optimization, and quality assurance.Problem-solving activities center on developing solutions to customer challenges. Consulting firms, research organizations, and custom solution providers prioritize activities like analysis, research, solution design, and knowledge management. These businesses often rely heavily on intellectual capital and specialized expertise.Platform/network activities focus on building and maintaining platforms that connect different user groups. Social media companies, marketplaces, and payment processors invest heavily in platform development, user acquisition, network effects cultivation, and ecosystem management.Strategic Activity SelectionNot all activities are equally important. Core activities directly create your primary value proposition and differentiate you from competitors. Supporting activities enable core activities but don't directly create customer value. Outsourceable activities can be performed by external partners without compromising competitive advantage.The key is identifying which activities are truly strategic versus those that are simply necessary. Strategic activities typically require unique capabilities, create competitive advantages, or directly impact customer value perception.Activity Optimization and EfficiencyProcess standardization reduces variability and improves efficiency. Standard operating procedures, quality checklists, and workflow automation help ensure consistent output while reducing training requirements and error rates.Automation opportunities should be evaluated for repetitive, rule-based activities. However, automation decisions must consider implementation costs, maintenance requirements, and potential impacts on flexibility and customer experience.Continuous improvement methodologies like Lean, Six Sigma, or Kaizen help systematically identify and eliminate waste, reduce cycle times, and improve quality. These approaches work best when embedded in company culture rather than treated as one-time initiatives.Resource Allocation and PrioritizationActivity-based costing helps understand the true cost of different activities, revealing opportunities for optimization or strategic focus shifts. Some activities may appear low-cost but consume significant indirect resources or management attention.Capacity planning ensures you can perform key activities at required volumes and quality levels. This involves forecasting demand, planning resource requirements, and building appropriate flexibility for volume fluctuations.Make-or-buy decisions determine whether to perform activities internally or outsource them. Internal performance provides more control but requires investment in capabilities and resources. Outsourcing can provide cost savings and access to specialized expertise but may create dependency risks.Innovation and Activity EvolutionActivity innovation can create competitive advantages by performing necessary tasks in fundamentally different ways. Netflix transformed movie distribution from physical to digital. Uber revolutionized transportation through platform-based ride-sharing.Technology integration continuously changes how activities can be performed. Artificial intelligence automates knowledge work, Internet of Things enables real-time monitoring, and cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure.Experimentation frameworks help test new approaches to key activities without disrupting core operations. Pilot programs, A/B testing, and sandbox environments allow innovation while managing risk.Activity InterdependenciesKey activities rarely operate in isolation. Sequential dependencies require activities to be completed in specific orders. Parallel dependencies allow simultaneous execution but require coordination. Reciprocal dependencies involve activities that mutually influence each other.Bottleneck identification reveals activities that constrain overall system performance. Optimizing bottlenecks often provides greater impact than improving non-constraining activities.Activity mapping visualizes workflows and identifies handoffs, delays, and redundancies. This analysis often reveals opportunities for streamlining or reorganization.Capability BuildingCore competencies develop through repeated performance of key activities. These capabilities become sources of competitive advantage that are difficult for competitors to replicate.Learning curves reduce costs and improve quality as organizations become more experienced with key activities. However, learning requires deliberate effort and knowledge capture, not just repetition.Talent development ensures your organization has the skills needed to perform key activities effectively. This includes hiring, training, retention, and succession planning for critical roles.Digital Transformation ImpactData-driven activities use analytics to optimize performance and decision-making. Customer service activities benefit from predictive analytics that anticipate issues. Marketing activities leverage data to improve targeting and personalization.Platform thinking transforms traditional activities into platform-based approaches. Traditional retailers become marketplaces. Traditional manufacturers become ecosystem orchestrators.Agile methodologies enable faster iteration and adaptation of key activities. This approach works particularly well for activities involving uncertainty or rapid change.Performance MeasurementKey performance indicators (KPIs) should directly measure activity effectiveness and efficiency. Production activities might focus on throughput, quality, and cost per unit. Customer service activities might emphasize response time, resolution rate, and satisfaction scores.Benchmarking compares your activity performance against industry standards or best practices. This analysis reveals improvement opportunities and competitive positioning.Predictive metrics help anticipate future performance based on leading indicators. These enable proactive management rather than reactive problem-solving.Activity Strategy IntegrationYour key activities must align with your value proposition and business model. Premium value propositions often require high-quality, customized activities. Low-cost strategies emphasize efficiency and standardization.Activity systems create competitive advantages through interconnected activities that reinforce each other. Southwest Airlines' key activities all support their low-cost positioning: point-to-point routing, single aircraft type, quick turnarounds, and no-frills service.The most successful businesses continuously evaluate and evolve their key activities, ensuring they remain focused on value creation while adapting to changing market conditions and customer needs. This requires balancing operational excellence in current activities with strategic flexibility for future evolution.
